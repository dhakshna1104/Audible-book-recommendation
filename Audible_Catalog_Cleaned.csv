He has become a billionaire and investment sage by buying chunks of companies and holding onto them, managing them as businesses, and eventually reaping huge profits for himself and investors in Berkshire Hathaway. The first two editions of The Warren Buffett Way gave investors their first in-depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind the spectacular success of living legend Warren E. Buffett. Tracing Warren Buffett's career from the beginning, Hagstrom told listeners exactly how, starting with an initial investment of only $100 Buffett built a business empire and has an estimated net worth of $44 billion. The Third Edition of The Warren Buffett Way will focus on the timeless principles and strategies behind Buffett's extraordinary investment success. There will be new chapters on the important distinctions between investment and trading and an examination of the most successful disciples of Warren Buffett.

This becomes relevant today when we are increasingly indulging and isolating the self (self-improvement, self-actualization, self-realization - even selfies!) We forget that we live in an ecosystem of others, where we can nourish each other with food, love and meaning, even when we fight.

Building on her four principles of eating right from Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight, she goes on to share her four strategies (Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep and Relationships) for each of these phases and especially the lifestyle disorders of Pcod, hypothyroid and diabetes. Rujuta, in her usual indomitable style, debunks (rubbishes rather) myths related to food, hormones and workouts; forces us to rethink our belief that pregnancy, menopause, hypothyroid, etc, come in the way of losing weight; and reveals just how easy it is to remain healthy, strong and fit through one's life.

An inspiring and motivating audiobook, it draws success mantras from the life and work of the actor. Describing it as a self-help book, the author goes back to the early struggles of Bachchan, connecting them with our deepest aspirations. What is success, and does happiness precede or follow success? He reflects on such questions by digging deeper into the trials and tribulations of Bachchan’s rise to fame. In his conversational style, the writer cites examples from everyday life and invites the listeners to think with him, as if he were sharing his thoughts and wisdom with a friend. He points out that in Indian cinema, any film that has a star cast will easily land a producer, distributors and dates for theatrical release and even draw in the advance bookings. Similarly, happiness is a superstar, he says. Through the audiobook, he explains how we can take control of our destiny and be the producer, director and star of our own lives. Bachchan’s life provides insight into how one can persevere through hope, despair, challenges and opportunities. What can we learn from his personal journey and from his larger-than-life image on the screen?   ",5 hours and 28 minutes,"Biographies of Celebrities & Entertainment Professionals, Personal Success, Biographies & Autobiographies"

The very term itself, when approached comparatively, opens up a Pandora's box of cultural differences.   ",4 hours and 56 minutes,"Literary History & Criticism, Linguistics, Literary Theory"

Everest, once said: “You can never conquer the mountain. You can only conquer yourself.” Yet, when the vast majority of people encounter obstacles to their goals, or difficulties on the journey of life, they tend to put their focus on the mountain - things that they cannot control, things outside of themselves - rather than turning inward, taking responsibility and conquering the self. That process of conquering the self is another name for that priceless quality of personality we call self-discipline. And, in this priceless collection of great ideas in sound from the world leader in personal development, Nightingale-Conant, you will be provided with all of the essential tools of self-discipline to conquer the self in every major arena of life.

Published in 1952, it has remained relevant throughout the years. The author explains how changes in thinking processes can influence outcomes that seem otherwise inevitable. His approach, based on faith and optimism, has laid the foundation for a stream of thought structured in sound principles to achieve desired goals and achieve happiness. It is a philosophy of faith that does not ignore the problems of life, but rather is dedicated to showing a practical way to stand in the face of adversity and overcome obstacles.

But how could a nation become one of the world's fastest-growing economies when it's governed by a weak, ineffective state? And wouldn't it be wonderful if India also grew during the day - in other words, if public policy supported private enterprise? What India needs, Gurcharan Das argues, is a strong liberal state. Such a state would have the authority to take quick, decisive action; it would have the rule of law to ensure those actions are legitimate; and finally, it would be accountable to the people. However, India has always had a weak state and a strong society, says Das, which means that achieving something better will be an uphill struggle.",8 hours and 46 minutes,"Literary Essays, Essays"

Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content,Ann Handley,-1.0,,668.0,"Finally a go-to guide to creating and publishing the kind of content that will make your business thrive. Everybody Writes is a go-to guide to attracting and retaining customers through stellar online communication, because in our content-driven world, every one of us is, in fact, a writer. If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers. Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt... does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary? Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring. That means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. So being able to communicate well in writing isn't just nice; it's necessity. And it's also the oft-overlooked cornerstone of nearly all our content marketing.

Fear and uncertainty envelope him; between him and his achievement stand hurdles, both real and imaginary: a possible spin from the bowler can overwhelm him, his own anxiety can paralyze him, cheering fans can distract him. He needs divine intervention then. He needs to focus, get rid of all hurdles, perform, get the final run, and achieve what he so longs for. In other words, he needs to think of Ganapati. ",2 hours and 27 minutes,"Hinduism, Meditation, Hinduism"

Seasoned psychotherapist Miriam Greenspan argues that it's the avoidance and denial of the dark emotions that results in the escalating psychological disorders of our time: depression, anxiety, addiction, psychic numbing, and irrational violence. And she shows us how to trust the wisdom of the dark emotions to guide, heal, and transform our lives and our world.",12 hours and 56 minutes,"Depression, Stress Management, Psychology"

This expressed the underlying impetus - a break from the view of the libido and its functions as taught by Sigmund Freud, which Jung had earlier adopted.

The Great Disappointment: How Narendra Modi Squandered a Unique Opportunity to Transform the Indian Economy,Salman Anees Soz,2.6,17.0,879.0,"As the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government completes its current term ahead of the General Elections 2019, it is time to evaluate its performance, specifically in terms of its management of the economy. This book is a critical assessment of five years of the brand of economics Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed, often referred to as ""Modinomics"". Brought into power with the biggest political mandate in almost three decades, did the NDA government succeed in gainfully transforming India's economic trajectory or did it squander a once-in-a-generation opportunity? This book conjectures it is the latter, and analyses why the Modi government's stewardship of the economy is a ""great disappointment"".",-1,NONE

Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,4.7,35.0,703.0,"A practical four-step methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom - and business school curricula - teaches us that making trade-offs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious trade-off just isn't good enough: the choices in front of us don't get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board - all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a ""third and better way"" to make important choices in the face of unacceptable trade-offs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving. It lays out the authors' practical four-step methodology, which can be applied in virtually any context: ",-1,NONE

Thirty-seven-year-old Jake Hersh is a film director of modest success, a faithful husband, and a man in disgrace. His alter ego is his cousin Joey, a legend in their childhood neighbourhood in Montreal. Nazi-hunter, adventurer, and hero of the Spanish Civil War, Joey is the avenging horseman of Jake’s impotent dreams. When Jake becomes embroiled in a scandalous trial in London, England, he puts his own unadventurous life on trial as well, finding it desperately wanting as he steadfastly longs for the Horseman’s glorious return.

Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle,Dervla Murphy,4.7,167.0,633.0,"Full Tilt is the inspiring true story of Dervla Murphy's 1963 journey from Ireland to India on an Armstrong Cadet bicycle, and the trials, landscapes, and cultures she encountered along the way. The route takes her through the valleys and snowy mountain passes of Europe and India to the scorching deserts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the metal of her bicycle, Rozinante (named after Don Quixote's steed), becomes too hot to touch. She travels alone, without luxuries, sleeping on the floors of teahouses or on blankets outdoors, vulnerable to wild animals, insects, and thieves. However, she is often met with generosity and kindness, and shares many meaningful encounters with the locals. Her portrayal here gives a fascinating insight into the unique communities of the Middle East in the early 1960s. ",-1,NONE
